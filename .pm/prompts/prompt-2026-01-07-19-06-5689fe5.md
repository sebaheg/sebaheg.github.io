# Actor
You are a senior software engineer.

# Context and goals
I would like to be add a "publish" flag to the header of each blogpost. If the flag is set to "false" then I would like to unlist the blog post from the website as well as not indexing it on google and other search engines. If the flag is set to "true" then I want it to show up on website and be indexed as well.
