I'm an energy engineer working as a power trader in Sweden.

I have a passion for contributing to fight climate change. I am a strong believer in the power of algorithms and want to use them to improve the world.

My mission is to improve energy systems by using methods from computational science and machine learning in order to improve how decisions are made, both manual and automatic.

In this blog I will share some of my thoughts and insights. I am not an expert, I write to learn more and interact with others. So do not hesitate to comment on what I do.
