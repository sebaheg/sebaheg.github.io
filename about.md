I'm an energy engineer working as a power trader in Sweden.

I have a passion for contributing to fight climate change. I am a strong believer in the power of algorithms and want to use them to improve the world.

My mission is to make energy systems more efficient and increase the competitiveness of renewable energy such as solar and wind. I see a big potential in using methods from computational science, machine learning and meteorology in order to improve how decisions are made in these systems, both manual and automatic.

In this blog I will share some of my thoughts and insights. I am not an expert, I write to learn more and interact with others. So do not hesitate to comment on what I do.
