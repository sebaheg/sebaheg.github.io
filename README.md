1. Existential risk
1. Climate Change (history and joseph fourier)
1. The Bill Gates Equation
1. The Rise of Renewable Energy (Reference IEA report)
1. The Energy Transformation (structural change of energy system)
1. The Grid Stability Problem (TSO - SVK)
1. Flexibility is Key (key for allowing for transformation, what are the sources of flexibility?)
1. Day-Ahead Electricity Market (from physical problem to market design)
1. Intraday Electricity Market (not really a market more a horizon)
1. Artificial Intelligence (what is artificial intelligence)
1. Artificial Intelligence in Energy (include MIT Review)
1. The Electricity Forecast Problem (what is the problem and how can it be defined)
1. Uncertainty in Electricity Forecasts (why is it needed? refer to paper)
