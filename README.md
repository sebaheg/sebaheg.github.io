# My Blog
In this blog, I am writing about how algorithms can help in the fight against climate change. 

## Planned Blog Posts
As always, I have way more ideas than I have time to realise. These are the blog posts I have planned for at the moment: 

1. Existential risk
1. Climate Change (history and joseph fourier)
1. Big World, Small Planet
1. The Bill Gates Equation
1. The Rise of Renewable Energy (Reference IEA report)
1. The Energy Transformation (structural change of energy system)
1. The Grid Stability Problem (TSO - SVK)
1. Flexibility is Key (key for allowing for transformation, what are the sources of flexibility?)
1. Day-Ahead Electricity Market (from physical problem to market design)
1. Intraday Electricity Market (not really a market more a horizon)
1. Artificial Intelligence (what is artificial intelligence)
1. Artificial Intelligence in Energy (include MIT Review)
1. The Electricity Forecast Problem (what is the problem and how can it be defined)
1. Uncertainty in Electricity Forecasts (why is it needed? refer to paper) 
1. Regional windpower data in sweden
1. Intraday trading 
1. Meteorology - wind profile
1. knapsack problem
1. autocorrelation
1. multiple weather
1. SHMI API (multigrid) (try geoviews by bokeh)
1. Navier stokes
1. IEA insights 
1. Algorithmic trading
1. Bayesian statistics
1. Computational fluid dynamics 

## Planned Changes to the Blog
There are wanted changes to the blog that still are not implemented in the jekyll tempelate. These are: 

* Add posibility to comment on posts
* Come up with a name for the blog and buy an .com domain
* Change the tab logo to one specifically made for me. 
* Add tags to the blog posts. 
* Add a way to filter blog posts according to tags

I want to have the following tags: 

* Math
* Data
* Visualization
* Meteorology
* Machine learning
* Electricity market
* Python
* Time Series
* computing
* CFD
* Game Theory
* Forecasting

## On Writing blog posts
General advice on writing blog posts: 

* Start by sketching out what you want to include in the post. 
* Write about stuff that you, yourself want to learn more about.
