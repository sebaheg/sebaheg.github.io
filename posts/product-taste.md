*Product taste* seems to be all the rage these days. Product sense, product intuition, 

As software becomes easier to build, differentiation is shifting from technology to taste. But what does taste even mean? 

Some seem to confuse it with the simplistic view taste just equals design, but most recognise that it's a superset. Others compare it with being opinionated, but that feels more like a necessary rather than sufficient condition. You can be opinionated and at the same time fail to resonate with a wider audience. In that sense, taste is something more intersubjective than subjective. Just like a master chef develops taste from experience and sensitivity to the craft - we product people need too.
