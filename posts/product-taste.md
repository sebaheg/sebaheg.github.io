*Product taste* seems to be all the rage these days. As software becomes easier to build, differentiation is shifting from technology to softer aspects like taste. But what does great product taste even entail? 

Some take the simplistic view that product taste is just equal to design. But really, it's more of a superset. Others compare it with being opinionated, but that feels more like a necessary rather than sufficient condition. You can be highly opinionated and at the same time fail to resonate with a wider audience. In that sense, taste is something more intersubjective than subjective. 

Words similar to "taste" have already been floating around in the product community, like *product intuition* or *product sense*. All these words hints at the idea that taste is something that cannot be taught - it has to be developed through experiences. But experiences alone won't cut it, there has to also be a sensitivity attuned to those experiences. In fact, [some thinkers argue](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9593004-a-new-formula-for-acquiring-ethical-knowledge-appeared-knowledge), the way to think about knowledge is: `testing here`


> knowledge = experience x sensitivity

Just like a master chef develops taste over time to deliver meals other people deeply enjoy - product people need too. 

But it's reasonable the term has an upswing now.


from experience and sensitivity to the craft - we product people need too.

Taste is not taught - it's developed. 

Needless to say, building a product always starts with answering "*who* is the user?". The user always lives in some context: problems to be solved, current workflows, incentive structures. Understanding the user is a necessary pre-condition to developing taste. 

The *where*, *what* and *how* of taste. 

- **What**: What is the functionality and focus of your product. What are the boundaries of your product and how are you channeling user attention. This is about tradeoffs and clarity of purpose. 
- **How**: How do you make the user feel when using the product? This is about the emotion, design, delight and cohesion of your product. Tap into mental models (naming)?  
- **Where**: Where are you taking the user with your product? How is the user becoming a better version of herself on this journery. Using a create product feels like being on a journey 

Taste is like a clustering region of many individuals in some sort of high-dimensional space. For food it's how the chemicals on your thoung creates subjective experience. For cognitive work, it's how the user experience relates to your pre-concieved mental models of the world. 

### Building products
No one knows everything, and thus no one has the ultimate taste. Taste always lives on a spectrum. The more confidence you have in your product taste, the more you will build your product based on conviction. With less confidence in taste, you need to resort more to exploration.
