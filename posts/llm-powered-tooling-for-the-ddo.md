### Intro
There is not a lack of blog posts and books on the topic of data-driven organisations (DDO). But in a world where the code is writing itself, I think some updates to our old frameworks and mental models are due. I'll implicitly focus on what I know best in this post - data work, especially, data science in vertical industries. 

### The promise of the data-driven organisation
The idea of a data-driven organisation is as old as... 

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.
### Key points
1) Company-maintained code-first intrastructure building blocks
2) Opinionated, domain-specific data model
3) Prompt-to-X (pipeline, dashboard, app, test, etc)
4) Visual Extensive test- and validation-layer


Why not build these primitives yourself as well? Well, even in a world where code is for free, every line of code adds to your technical debt. And when the code breaks, you can yell all day at Claude, the responsibility is still with you. If it's not core to your business your better of passing that headache on to someone else.
