# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

## Why I started this blog

I wanted a simple place to share my thoughts on technology, programming, and other topics that interest me.

### Key points

- Keep it simple
- Focus on content
- Share knowledge

## Code example

Here's a simple Python function:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Math with LaTeX

The quadratic formula is:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

And inline math works too: $E = mc^2$.

That's all for now!
