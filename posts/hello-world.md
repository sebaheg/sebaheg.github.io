# The promise of the data-driven organisation
A data-driven 

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.
#
1) Company-maintained code-first intrastructure building blocks
2) Opinionated, domain-specific data model
3) Prompt-to-X (pipeline, dashboard, app, test, etc)
4) Visual Extensive test- and validation-layer


### Key points

- Keep it simple
- Focus on content
- Share knowledge

## Code example

Here's a simple Python function:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Math with LaTeX

The quadratic formula is:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

And inline math works too: $E = mc^2$.

That's all for now!
