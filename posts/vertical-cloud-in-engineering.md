If the 2005-2015 was the era of the cloud platforms buildout (AWS, GCP and Azure), then 2015-2022 was the era when MLOps tooling ecosystem was built out and fragmented to [almost absurd levels](https://mad.firstmark.com/) with cheap capital during ZIRP. During the same time, general data platforms like Snowflake and Databricks have risen to dominant positions, and are now driving consolidation through acquisitions. What they showed was that it's not necessary to own underlying compute, storage and network as long as you create a great developer experience on top. This is hinting at how the future of data tooling will look like. 

The physical cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) provide horisontal products to anyone building on the cloud. Their target group is extremely wide, from people deploying personal websites to large businesses migrating production workloads to the cloud. What allowed the rise of Snowflake and Databricks was their focus on specific use cases and personas, specificly working with data. Snowflake focuses on data engineering teams and Databricks on data scientists working with big data. Their persona focus allowed them to create a superior user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX) that couldn't be matched by the horisontal clouds underneath. The list of persona-focused clouds platforms doesn't stop there: Datadog focused on DevOps engineers, Vercel on front-end engineers, Modal on ML/AI engineers and Rerun on robotics engineers. 

The common denominator is that all these platforms provide opinionated data tools by means of honing in on personas and use cases. The UX and DX goes hand-in-hand with the narrowing on the scope. So if UX and DX is the way to differentiate, and it requires narrowing of the scope, my bet is that this cycle will continue. I think that the next iteration will revolve around engineering industries: structural engineering, bio engineering, material engineering and energy engineering.
