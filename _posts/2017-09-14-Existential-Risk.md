title: Existential Risk
---
Imagine being on a spaceship travelling through the hostile space at 30 km/s. Outside, it is freezing cold. The hull of the spaceship is keeping you warm and protecting you from deadly ultraviolet radiation. On the spaceship there is a limited supply of water, food, fuel and other necessities. A responsible capten would do everything in her power keep the passengers safe. She would struggle to avoid collision with asteroids, explosions onboard, overheating of the spaceship, degradation of the protecting hull and depletion of the limited resources. The name of the spaceship is planet earth. Its protecting hull is the atmosphere, ozon layer and its magnetic field. 

To me, this analogy makes it clear how fragile our life on earth is. This fact is excellently is captured by the speech [Pale Blue Dot]() by Carl Sagen. Nick Bostr√∂m defines existential risk as:

<p class="message">
Something that risk to destroy terrestial, intelligent life or heavily impair dess potential for all future.
