title: Climate Change
---

In a previous blog [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-16-Existential-Risk %}), I wrote about existential risks on different time scales. One existential risk I have been especially interested in for the last 5 year is climate change. Just as artificial general intelligence (AGI), climate change is an urgent existential risk and needs to be dealt with during this century. However, in contrast to the development of AGI, we know to a high degree of certainty what is causing climate change and what we must do to limit its impact and avoid devastating consequences. But still, we ignorantly take life as we know it for granted and our politicians are reluctant to act at the required pace postulated by climate scientists to keep Earth in a safe operating space. Both of which are mind-boggling to me. In this blog post I will review what is causing climate change and what its potential consequences are. 

Ever since the formation of the Earth, its climate has been changing dynamically due to factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by the Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, changes in albedo and greenhouse gas concentrations.   In fact, the miraculously stable state we are used to, called the Holocene, has only been present for the last 10000 years or so. To get here, it as been a bumpy ride as illustrated below.

When I look at this figure, I get amazed how lucky we as humans have been for the going into the Holocene. It is our Garden of Eden, the only place we know of that can sustain widespread modern life on Earth. It is also, most probably, the one reason that allowed us to become farmers in the first place. 

The mechanisms affecting climate change are called climate forcings and they can either be amplified or diminish by the Earth's feedback system. For example, as the Earth gets hotter the polar ice caps are melting changing the color of the ground from white to dark. As dark colors absorb more light the Earth is getting even warmer and more ice melts. This is an example of a positive feedback loop where an initial push in the wrong direction can lead to an irreversible new state without ice coverage on the poles. In this new iceless state, the mean temperature would be significantly larger. 

The concept of planetary feedback is commonly referred to as resilience by climate scientists. A resilient ecosystem is capable of maintaining the same state in the presence of internal or external stresses. But continous exposure for stress might deteriorate the system, making it less rebust. A hard enough push, or an slow but steady transition, might change the state (or regime) of the system. For example, temperature rises could potentially turn the Earth into new state without any glaciers. Or if temperatures decreases for some reason, it could lead us into an ice age. You could image the different states as stable equilibrium points of a ball in a gravitational field as shown below.

With advances in our standards of life and technology, we began spitting out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This caused antropogenic climate change, known as global warmning. Joseph fourier was the first to predict this in blablablabla...
