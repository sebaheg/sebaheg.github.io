title: Climate Change
---

In a previous blog [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-16-Existential-Risk %}), I wrote about existential risks on different time scales. One existential risk I have been especially interested in for the last 5 year is climate change. Just as artificial general intelligence (AGI), climate change is an urgent existential risk and needs to be dealt with during this century. However, in contrast to the development of AGI, we know to a high degree of certainty what is causing climate change and what we must do to limit its impact and avoid devastating consequences. But still, we ignorantly take life as we know it for granted and our politicians are reluctant to act at the required pace postulated by climate scientists to keep Earth in a safe operating space. Both of which are mind-boggling to me. In this blog post I will review what is causing climate change and what are its potential consequences. 

Let us first straighten out what climate change really is. Ever since the formation of the Earth, its climate has been changing dynamically due to factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by the Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions. In fact, the miraculously stable state we are used to, the Holocene, has only been present for the last 10000 years or so. To get here, it as been a bumpy ride as illustrated below.
