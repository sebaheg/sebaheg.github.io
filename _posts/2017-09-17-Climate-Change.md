title: Climate Change
---

In a previous blog [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-16-Existential-Risk %}), I wrote about existential risks on different time scales. One existential risk I have been especially interested in for the last 5 year is climate change. Just as artificial general intelligence (AGI), climate change is an urgent existential risk and needs to be dealt with during this century. However, in contrast to the development of AGI, we know to a high degree of certainty what is causing climate change and what we must do to limit its impact and avoid devastating consequences. But still, we ignorantly take life as we know it for granted and our politicians are reluctant to act at the required pace postulated by climate scientists to keep Earth in a safe operating space. Both of which are mind-boggling to me. In this blog post I will review what is causing climate change and what its potential consequences are.

Ever since the formation of the Earth, its climate has been changing dynamically due to factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by the Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, changes in albedo and greenhouse gas concentrations. In fact, the miraculously stable state we are used to, called the Holocene, has only been present for the last 10000 years or so. To get here, it as been a bumpy ride as illustrated below.

The data comes from Greenland ice cor When I look at this figure, I get amazed how lucky we humans have been for the going into the Holocene. It is our Garden of Eden, the only place we know of that can sustain widespread modern life on Earth. It is also, most probably, the one reason that allowed us to become farmers in the first place.

The mechanisms affecting climate change are called climate forcings and they can either be amplified or diminish by the Earth's feedback system. For example, as the Earth gets hotter the polar ice caps are melting changing the color of the ground from white to dark. As dark colors absorb more light the Earth is getting even warmer and more ice melts. This is an example of a positive feedback loop where an initial push in the wrong direction can lead to an irreversible new state without ice coverage on the poles. In this new iceless state, the mean temperature would be significantly larger.

The concept of planetary feedback is commonly referred to as resilience by climate scientists. A resilient ecosystem is capable of maintaining the same state in the presence of internal or external pressure. But continuous exposure to pressure might deteriorate the system, making it less rebust. A hard enough push, or an slow but steady transition, might irreversibly change the state (or regime) of the system. For example, temperature rises could potentially turn the Earth into new state without any glaciers. Or if temperatures decreases for some reason, it could lead us into an ice age. The transition from one state to another is usually characterized by tipping points where the system feedback changes from negative to positive. The implications of new state are very hard to make, we must expect the unexpected. Visually, you could imagine the different states as stable equilibrium points of a ball in a gravitational field as illustrated below.

During the last 50 years, after 10000 year of Holocene, the Earth has tipped into a new state, the Antropocene. In this state it is we, the humans, how is the largest force acting on the planet. The population increase and the advances in our standards of life and technology are putting immense stress on the planet. Human activity is causing deforestation, loss of biodiversity and increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to mention a few. In the last 50 year, we have gone from a small world on a big planet to a big world on a small planet. We can no longer treat the planet as a vast, stable and self-regulating system with unlimited resources.

The Holocene is our cherished home. Therefore, goal in the Antropocene and coming century is to keep the Earth in a Holocene-like state. Researchers at [Stockholm Resilience Center](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/) mapped out the potential threats that potentially could push the planet out of the Holocene into the unkown. They called their framework [planetary bounderies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries), which is the safe operating space of the world. Later on, they revised the framework to also include the lower boundary needed sustain the world population and fulfill the [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) (SDG) by the UN. This trade-off resulted in a doughnut-shape just and safe operating space for humanity shown below.

Notice that climate change is only one of the planetary boundaries. Moreover, all boundaries are hyperconnected and affect each other. For example, climate change would lead to less availability of fresh water. The planetary bounderies framework holistically gives the big picture. At this point however, climate change is one of the most urgent boundaries (together with loss of biodiversity and overload of nitrogen and phosphorus) to be dealt with.

The antropogenic climate change is called global warming. Today, the planet is heating at a rate unprecedented in all of recoded history. This is more evident than every before, see this great [visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4Ra2HR27pQ) for example. Furthermore, we have been aware of this for a long time. The mathematician Joseph Fourier showed already in 1824 that without the presence of the atmosphere, the Earth would be far colder. The Swedish physicist, build upon this and discovered in 1896 that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere affects the mean temperature on Earth. This effect is caused by heat trapping gases letting visible light from the sun pass and absorbing low frequency infrared light emitted form the Earth. Today, link between greenhouse gases and increase in mean temperature is clear for the vast majority of scientists.

we began spitting out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This caused antropogenic climate change, known as global warmning. Joseph fourier was the first to predict this in blablablabla...

safe and just operating space for humanity
And it points towards a future that can provide for every person’s needs while safeguarding the living world on which we all depend. And it points towards a future that can provide for every person’s needs while safeguarding the living world on which we all depend.
