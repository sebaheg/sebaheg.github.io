<p>Global warming (anthropogenic climate change) has been ongoing since the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Start with that we need to get to zero. Reference the IPCC paper. When do we need to be where?</p>

<p>Check with rosling how many people we will be on the planet? Use material more like 9-10 billion people?
2050 and 2100
Bill Gates cites scientists’ estimates that to avoid the worst effects of climate change the biggest carbon-emitting countries must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, and the world must more or less stop such emissions entirely by 2100. And that’s not going to happen if we continue on our current trajectory.

<p>Bill Gates cites scientists’ estimates that to avoid the worst effects of climate change the biggest carbon-emitting countries must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, and the world must more or less stop such emissions entirely by 2100. And that’s not going to happen if we continue on our current trajectory.</p>

<p>How much is the total mount of CO2??</p>

<p>Efficiency, E, the energy for each service — here, finally, we have some good news.  We have something that is not going up because of various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of creating buildings. There are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially; some individual services can be reduced by as much as 90 percent.  There are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the room for improvement is far, far less. If we are optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three or even perhaps a factor of six.  But for these first three factors, we have gone from 26 billion [tons of CO2] to at best maybe 13 billion tons.  And that just won’t cut it.”</p>

<p>The human influence on the global climate system is clear. This is, for instance, manifested through raising temperatures in the atmosphere and oceans, dimin- ishing amount of snow and ice in the pole areas and raising sea level. Climate change already has widespread impacts on humans and ecosystems. By further warming of the planet, the risk of severe irreversible and pervasive impacts in- creases. Therefore, climate change is a real threat to sustainable development of the human species on Earth.
Climate change is caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere today are at least unprecedented during the last 800 000 years. Each year, the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emitted into the atmosphere is about 50 billion tons (IPCC 2014). The yearly amount of emitted carbon dioxide equivalent can be expressed using a version of the Kaya identity proposed by Gates (2010) according to</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
   \sum CO_2 = P \, \times \, S \, \times E \, \times C
\end{equation}</script>

<p>Energy miracle. Not really needed. Deploy current technologies.</p>

<p>People (P) refers to the number of people living on the planet, with a magnitude of about 7 billion today and an expected value closer to 10 billion by 2050.
Services (S) refers to all of the services that we use, including things like the food that we eat, clothing that we wear, electronics, heating, transportation, etc.
Efficiency (E) refers to the energy used for each service. This number has actually been dropping over time, though it is nowhere near zero (and probably can’t be)
CO2 per unit of energy (CO2) refers to the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the environment for each unit of energy that is demanded to provide the services that the world’s population uses.</p>

<p>Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are, there’s some uncertainty there, but not very much. And there’s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. I [have] asked the top scientists on this several times, do we really have to get down to near zero? Can’t we just cut it in half or a quarter? And the answer is that, until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise…This is something that has to get to zero.”</p>

<p>where P is the number of people on the planet, S is the services per person, E is the energy per service and C is the emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents per energy. According to IPCC (2014), substantial emission reductions over the course of the next few decades and near zero emissions by the end of the century are needed in order to likely limit global warming below 2 ◦C relative to pre-industrial levels. This means that at least one of the four quantities in equation (1.1) needs to approach zero.
Knowing that both the number of people P and the services per person S are likely to increase, the reductions can be made only to the energy per service E and the emissions per energy C. The most optimistic estimates of the reduction in E is only about a factor 6, which is not enough to meet the goal. Therefore, we are reliant on the last quantity C to approach zero in order to avoid continued global warming and to allow for sustainable development on a climate-resilient planet. This, in turn, means increased need of a decarbonised energy supply built on technologies such as solar, hydro and wind.
The focus in this study is wind power and how it can be modelled in order to ultimately increase its value and allow for large scale implementation in the power system.</p>

<p>Bill Gates: Yeah, it’s important for people who care about climate to not think it’s easy to solve.</p>

<p>The equation is: How many people are there? And that’s P, which today is about 7 billion, and will grow to be bigger than 9 billion.</p>

<p>Then you take how many energy-related services each person takes advantage of — that’s heating, cooling, transport, lighting. We call that S, and that will go up quite a bit as poor people in India are getting lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration. The average number of services used by a person will increase, and it should — that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Then you have E, the energy used per service. In some areas, like lighting, that number can go down a lot. In some, like transport, planes, making fertilizer — those processes are extremely optimized, and so there’s not that much room to innovate on the energy-per-service front. Even if you’re optimistic about that, maybe you’ll get to 0.6. That is, 40 percent more efficient across all services.</p>

<p>And so if we take these first three factors — 7 billion going to 9 billion, double the services per person, and efficiency at about 0.6, that’s increasing [emissions].</p>

<p>The last factor is C, the carbon per unit of energy. And so if you multiply today, you get 36 billion tons. And if you multiply in the future, you need to get zero.</p>

<p>And so the first three factors are not going [to change] — the first one is going up; the second one, hopefully, is going up; the third one is going down, but not enough to offset those other two.</p>

<p>You have to take transport, industry, household, electricity — and, at least in the middle income and rich countries, put it into a zero emission mode.</p>

<p>Gates believes we need a “miracle” to get to zero carbon emissions in a world of 9 billion people, most of whom are wealthier (a doubling in terms of services S) than they are now. we already have the cost reductions.
New technoloy takes time to develop. We do not have time for that right now.</p>

<p>Give order of magnitude how much we can reduce each one of them.</p>

<p>Talk about planetary bounderies and my previous post. The problem is bigger than this:
While most environmental advocates applaud Gates’ speech for raising awareness on the issue of climate change and advocating carbon-neutral sources of energy, critics are questioning whether his approach to this problem is too narrow-minded. World Changing wrote, “The biggest flaw is that the Gates Climate Equation could lead to carbon blindness, a self-defeating willingness to destroy critical environmental systems in the name of saving the planet from climate change. Climate is not the only absolutely vital planetary boundary we’re straining. The biosphere transcends the climate crisis. Logging our forests, over-burdening our oceans, converting land for agriculture and grazing, all these are huge contributors to our climate problem, and restoring the capacities of natural systems to absorb carbon dioxide is a critical part of the solution.  The answer to the problem of cars and automotive emissions, for instance, isn’t designing a better car; it’s designing a better city.” COPY</p>

<p>Others have argued that our focus should be on technology deployment, not research and development. Climate Progress wrote, “The technologies we have today, plus a few that are on the verge of being commercialized, can provide the needed low-carbon energy.  Breaking down the barriers to their deployment now is much, much more important than developing new ‘breakthrough’ efficient TILTs [Terrific Imaginary Low-carbon Technology], since those would simply fail in the marketplace because of the same barriers.” COPY</p>
