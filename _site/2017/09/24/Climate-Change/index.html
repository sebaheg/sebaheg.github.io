  <p>In a previous blog <a href="/2017/09/16/Existential-Risk/">post</a>, I wrote about existential risks on different time scales. One existential risk I have been especially interested in for the last 5 year is climate change. Just as artificial general intelligence (AGI), climate change is an urgent existential risk and needs to be dealt with during this century. However, in contrast to the development of AGI, we know to a high degree of certainty both what is causing climate change and what we must do to limit its impact and avoid devastating consequences. But still, we ignorantly take life as we know it for granted and our politicians are reluctant to act at the required pace postulated by climate scientists to keep Earth in a safe operating space. Both of which are mind-boggling to me. In this blog post, I will review what is causing climate change and what its potential consequences are.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-climate-change">How does the climate change?</h3>
<p>Ever since the formation of the Earth, its climate has been changing dynamically due to factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by the Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, changes in albedo and greenhouse gas concentrations. In fact, the miraculously stable state we are used to, called the Holocene, has only been present for the last 10 000 years or so. To get here, it as been a bumpy ride as illustrated below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/climate-change.jpg" alt="Climate Change" /></p>

<p>The data comes from Greenland ice core samples. Temperatures can be derived from the concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses preserved in small bubbles trapped in the ice core. When I look at this figure, I get amazed how lucky we humans have been for the going into the Holocene. It is our Garden of Eden, the only place we know of that can sustain widespread modern life on Earth. It is also, most probably, the one reason that allowed us to become farmers in the first place.</p>

<p>The mechanisms affecting climate change are called climate forcings and they can either be amplified or diminish by the Earth’s feedback system. For example, as the Earth gets hotter the polar ice caps are melting changing the color of the ground from white to dark. As dark colors absorb more light the Earth is getting even warmer and more ice melts. This is an example of a positive feedback loop where an initial push in the wrong direction can lead to an irreversible new state without ice coverage on the poles. In this new iceless state, the mean temperature would be significantly higher.</p>

<p>The concept of planetary feedback is commonly referred to as resilience by climate scientists. A resilient ecosystem is capable of maintaining the same state in the presence of internal or external pressure. But continuous exposure to pressure might deteriorate the system, making it less robust. A hard enough push, or an slow but steady transition, might irreversibly change the state (or regime) of the system. For example, temperature rises could potentially turn the Earth into new state without any glaciers. Or if temperatures decreases for some reason, it could lead us into an ice age. The transition from one state to another is usually characterized by nonlinear tipping points where the system feedback changes from negative to positive. The implications of new state are very hard to make, we must expect the unexpected. Visually, you can imagine the different states as stable equilibrium points of a ball in a gravitational field as illustrated below. The deeper the cup holding the ball, the higher the systems resilience to pressures.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-the-anthropocene">Welcome to the anthropocene</h3>
<p>During the last 50 years, after 10 000 year of Holocene, the Earth has tipped into a new state, the Anthropocene. In this state it is we, the humans, how is the largest force acting on the planet. The population increase and the advances in our standards of life and technology are putting immense pressure on the planet. Human activity is causing deforestation, loss of biodiversity and increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from energy transformation, transport and animal husbandry to mention a few. In the last 50 year, we have gone from a small world on a big planet to a big world on a small planet. We can no longer treat the planet as a vast, stable and self-regulating system with unlimited resources.</p>

<p>The Holocene is our cherished home and we do not know what to expect in other states. Therefore, goal in the Antropocene and coming century is to keep the Earth in a Holocene-like state. Researchers at <a href="http://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Center</a> mapped out the potential threats that potentially could push the planet out of the Holocene into the unkown. They called their framework <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries">planetary bounderies</a>, which is the safe operating space of the world. Later on, they revised the framework to also include the lower boundary needed to sustain the world population and fulfill the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs">sustainable development goals</a> (SDG) by the UN. This trade-off resulted in a doughnut-shape just and safe operating space for humanity shown below.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="550" height="500" src="/images/operating-space.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>This doughnut points towards a future that can provide for everyones needs while safeguarding the living world on which we all depend. Notice that climate change is only one of the planetary boundaries. Moreover, all boundaries are hyperconnected and affect each other. For example, climate change could lead to less availability of fresh water. The planetary boundaries framework is an holistic approach that gives the big picture of our safe operating space. We need to deal with all challenges threatening the development our modern society. At this point however, climate change is one of the most urgent boundaries (together with loss of biodiversity and overload of nitrogen and phosphorus). It must therefore be one of the first to be dealt with.</p>

<h3 id="global-warming">Global warming</h3>
<p>The mathematician Joseph Fourier showed already in 1824 that without the presence of the atmosphere, the Earth would be far colder. The Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius, build upon this and discovered in 1896 that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere affects the mean temperature on Earth. This effect is caused by heat trapping gases letting visible light from the sun pass and absorbing (and remitting) low frequency infrared radiation emitted form the Earth.</p>

<p>The anthropogenic climate change is called global warming. Today, the planet is heating at a rate unprecedented in all of recoded history. This is more evident than every before. An illustration of this is given below, showing the increase in measured temperatures.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="350" src="/images/temperature-anomaly.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>It can be seen from the record of global temperature that it is composed of fluctuations on several time scales. Therefore, it is not sure that a following year will be hotter than its preceding year. However, it can be said to a quite high degree of certainty that a following decade will be hotter than its preceding decade. Another great visualization of this can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4Ra2HR27pQ">here</a>. We have been aware of this for a long time.</p>

<p>Today, the link between greenhouse gases and increase in mean temperature is clear for the vast majority (more than 97 percent) of climate scientists. In the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 2014</a>, it was concluded that:</p>

<p class="message">
  "Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven
  largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric
  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in
  at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers,
  have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been
  the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."
</p>

<p>This link can be seen by plotting temperature and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane next to each other as below. But one should be careful. Correlation does not infer causality. In reality, the relationship between the to variables is interlinked. Increasing temperature releases carbon dioxide from oceans into the atmosphere and increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere results in a stronger greenhouse effect.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="650" height="300" src="/images/temperature-co2.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>What is not clear is to which degree nonlinearities can come into play. Melting of ice caps is not the only positive feedback out there. Other examples are the release of carbon dioxide (and water vapor) from the oceans as they heat up and release of methane from thawing parmafrosts. Both contributing to a stronger greenhouse effect and thus global warming. Scientists have hypothesized that these effects may lead to a runaway greenhouse effect. A planet gone wild. Much like the greenhouse effect on Venus, with a surface temperature of more than 450 degree Celsius.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-impacts">What are the impacts?</h3>
<p>The impacts of climate change will differ depending on the geographical region. Some areas will get warmer, some hotter. Some areas will get dryer some more humid. But overall, it is clear that the planet is getting warmer and dryer.</p>

<p>Apart from increased mean temperature and expansion of deserts into the subtropics, some anticipated changes are melting of ice caps, raising sea level and more precipitation and extreme weather. Even if it is very hard to attribute a specific extreme weather event to global warming, they will become more common from a statistical viewpoint. This is because of the higher energy content stored in the oceans and the increased water evaporation caused by higher temperatures.</p>

<p>Because of the high degree of inertia of the climate system (atmosphere, oceans and geosphere), it is likely that the coming effects of global warming will persist for many decades and centuries to come. Picture it like one of those big cruisers cutting through the water at full blast and suddenly turning of the engines. The inertia of the cruiser would keep it on course for a good while. Exactly the same is true for the climate system. Many experts think that, when accounting for this, we have already crossed the 2 degree Celsius goal agreed upon by the United Nations.</p>

<p>But it is still possible to limit the damage done by global warming. The first place to start is by limiting the root cause reduce the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions have stopped to increase. However, in order to have a reasonable chance to limit the global warming to 2 degrees, we must bend the curve and go towards zero emissions by the end of the century.</p>

<h3 id="a-worthy-challenge">A worthy challenge</h3>
<p>The climate crisis is a fact. Our generation can thank science for informing us about how we are undermining the stability and ability of planet Earth to support our modern society. There is no time for inability to take action, we must act now and decisively. We can buy green electricity, eat less meat and recycle waste. But we must also try to affect the decision makers. We can, if we want, turn the climate crisis into an opportunity, by appropriate regulation we can unleash innovation. We need to internalize, the greenhouse gas externality by putting a tax an carbon. I believe in markets, but they need to regulated to account for social and environment aspects.</p>

<p>I’d like to finish this blog post by a quote from Al Gore:</p>

<p class="message">
  "How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts? A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do. We ought to approach with a sense of profound joy and gratitude. That we are the generation about which, a thousands years from now, philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying: they where the ones, that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future"
