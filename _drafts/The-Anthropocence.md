The last 12 000 years of the history of Earth has been characterized by an exceptional stability of its climate system. It was back then, when we came out of the last Ice Age and entered the geological epoch called the Holocene. Agriculture was invented independently about the same time in several places on Earth. This was most likely not a coincidence, but catalyzed by the mild and predictable climate. As we knew what was coming up, we could plan for the future. Agriculture eventually led us to building civilizations, which has led us to the modern society many of us live in today. But we have forgotten what allowed for this in the first place and our bumpy ride to get here. We live in the delusion of planetary short-sightedness. Actually, the latin meaning of the word Holocene translates to "entirely recent".

The modern life we live today started in England around 1750 with the invention of the steam engine by James Watt. This in turn, was one of the driving forces of the industrial revolution. During all this time, the main drivers of global change were all natural. These drivers were for example solar variation due to changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions and proliferation and abatement of life. Accordingly, we have treated the planet as a wast unaffectable system that can absorb any disturbance thrown at it.



There is now overwhelming evidence the the main driver of planetary

This now looks unlikely. When you look at the problem from this point of view, says Rockström and colleagues, it becomes apparent that the holocene climate is the desired state for society and the economy.


There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is the growing human population’s demand for energy, food, goods, services and information, and its disposal of its waste products.


Global change does not operate in isolation but rather interacts with an almost bewildering array of natural variability modes and also with other human-driven effects at many scales. Especially important are those cases where interacting stresses cause a threshold to be crossed and a rapid change in state or functioning to occur.  

Created planetary bounderis that sets limits to growth. stay away from tipping points.


Never in the 4.6 billion history of the earth has a single species controlled so much energy, resources and land. The great acceleration is an event of planetary significance. Scared or proud.


The other notable feature of the new analysis is the way in which the authors link it to the debate about the proposition that the Earth has now, as a result of human activity, entered a new geological period, the Anthropocene, in which human activity has become a major force in shaping the planet. The various features of the Great Acceleration tend to confirm this idea, because human impacts on the biosphere and atmosphere have grown to now be on a completely unprecedented scale.

As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase they react in a relatively limited way for a long time before reaching a threshold, then they can melt rapidly. The exact position of a threshold is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint. So, a planetary boundary is the safe level, based on the best available evidence, beyond which you don’t want to transgress for fear of crossing the threshold.




Human impacts on the Earth system do not operate in separate, simple cause-effect responses. A single type of human-driven change triggers a large number of responses in the Earth system, which themselves cascade through the system, often merging with patterns of natural variability.  
The responses seldom follow linear chains, but more often interact with each other, sometimes damping the effects of the original human forcing and at other times amplifying them. Responses become feedbacks, which in turn can lead to further forcings that can alter the functioning of the Earth system.   
The nature of the Earth system’s responses to the increasing anthropogenic forcing is more complex than simple cause-effect relationships, such as greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming.
IDEA: remind again that there is a complex relationship between all parameters.

For example::
Fossil-fuel combustion produces a range of gases that have a large number of cascading effects. For example, carbon dioxide not only affects climate but directly affects how vegetation grows. It changes the carbonate chemistry in the ocean – the oceans are becoming more acidic, which in turn affects marine organisms. Changing carbonate chemistry is a factor in the widespread decline of coral reefs around the world.   
Fossil-fuel combustion also produces oxidising gases such as nitric oxide and sulphur dioxide that have well-known effects such as acidification and eutrophication of ecosystems.

Furthermore, mankind releases many toxic substances in the environment and even some, the chlorofluorocarbon gases, which are not toxic at all, but which nevertheless have led to the Antarctic “ozone hole” and which would have destroyed much of the ozone layer if no international regulatory measures to end their production had been taken. Coastal wetlands are also affected by humans, having resulted in the loss of 50% of the world’s mangroves. Finally, mechanized human predation (“fisheries”) removes more than 25% of the primary production of the oceans in the upwelling regions and 35% in the temperate continental shelf regions.
However, these gases can eventually contribute to changes in fundamental Earth system functioning because of their indirect effects on the radiative properties of the atmosphere, and hence climate. The mechanisms are through reactions with other gases plus their impacts on the ability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself through oxidation and other processes.
  Aerosols produced by fossil-fuel combustion can fertilise or reduce plant growth, depending on the circumstances, and directly affect human health. They also lead to large-scale direct or indirect modifications of climate.  

Climate change and loss of biodiversity are the two main factors:
They say that typically, initiatives around valuing nature tend to consider particular ecosystem services, and not the wide diversity of animals, plants and other organisms that give rise to these benefits. Their worry is that this lack of focus on biodiversity can lead to greatly underestimating the true value of what nature provides for humans and how much they depend on it.

we learn that 30-50% of the land surface has been transformed by human action.

Idea: analogy for not having the planetary bounderies

Two core boundaries – climate change and biosphere integrity – have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth System into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed. COPY


### Welcome to the Anthropocene
During the last 50 years, after 12 000 year of Holocene, the Earth has transitioned into a new state, the Anthropocene. In this state it is we, the humans, who are the largest force acting on the planet. The population increase and the advances in our standards of life and technology are putting immense pressure on the planet. Human activity is causing deforestation, loss of biodiversity and increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from energy transformation, transport and animal husbandry to mention a few. In the last 50 year, we have gone from a small world on a big planet to a big world on a small planet. We can no longer treat the planet as a vast, stable and self-regulating system with unlimited resources.

The Holocene is our cherished home and we do not know what to expect in other states. Therefore, the goal in the Anthropocene and coming century is to keep the Earth in a Holocene-like state. Researchers at [Stockholm Resilience Center](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/) mapped out the potential threats that potentially could push the planet out of the Holocene into the unknown. They called their framework [planetary bounderies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries), which is the safe operating space of the world. Later on, they revised the framework to also include a lower boundary needed to sustain the world population and fulfil the [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) (SDG) by the UN. This trade-off resulted in a doughnut-shape just and safe operating space for humanity shown below.

This doughnut points towards a future that can provide for everyones needs while safeguarding a prosperous planet on which we all depend. Notice that climate change is only one of the planetary boundaries. Moreover, all boundaries are hyper-connected and affect each other. For example, climate change could lead to less availability of fresh water. The planetary boundaries framework is a holistic approach that gives the big picture of our safe operating space. We need to deal with all challenges threatening the development our modern society. At this point however, climate change is one of the most urgent boundaries (together with loss of biodiversity and overload of nitrogen and phosphorus). It must therefore be one of the first to be dealt with.

There are glimmers of hope. A success story is the Montreal Protocol, banning ozone-depleting substances. Antarctic ozone loss is apparently stabilising. Many other indicators – carbon dioxide, temperature, ocean acidification, terrestrial biosphere degradation – however, remain on an unsustainable trajectory.

Feedbacks:
Loss of ice, loss of biodiversity, change in ocean and atmospheric circulation

Several feedbacks that add up can for the planet into a tipping point.

We need a planetary consciousness.
