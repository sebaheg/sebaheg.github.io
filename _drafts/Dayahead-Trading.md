Viewed from a economic stand point, electricity is a commodity (just like tomatoes or iron) that can be bought and sold on a market. Indeed, electricity is traded like this on financial such as [Nasdaq](http://www.nasdaqomx.com/transactions/markets/commodities). However, one peculiarity with electricity is that it must be produced and consumed at the same point in time (electricity in a copper wire travels almost at the speed of light, which is orders of magnitudes larger than the other relevant time scales in the power system). If there is not a balance between consumption and production of electricity, the frequency of the grid alternating current will change. The predetermined target frequency is 50 Hz

Therefore, special measures have to be taken on the physical market (which is coupled with actual delivery).

 In deregulated markets: Power price is set by the marginal cost. The cost of the power plant with the highest operation cost sets the price for everyone. COPY


 Wind power producer (and every other producer and consumer of electricity) have to report production and consumption separately in all price areas. The reason for multiple areas is include physical constraints on the transmission capacity in the design of the electricity market. This allows for different prices (set by the supply and demand curves) in different regions depending on their specific production and consumption. Ideally, this design would incentivize investment of production plants in regions with high supply. In the Swedish electricity market prices are usually coupled between all areas. However, since most of the production of electricity is in the north and the consumption centres are in the south decoupling between Swedish area SE1 and SE2 do happen sometimes.
