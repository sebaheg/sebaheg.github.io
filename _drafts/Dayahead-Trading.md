Viewed from a economic stand point, electricity is a commodity (just like tomatoes or iron) that can be bought and sold on a market. Indeed, electricity is traded like this on financial such as [Nasdaq](http://www.nasdaqomx.com/transactions/markets/commodities). However, one peculiarity with electricity is that it must be produced and consumed at the same point in time (electricity in a copper wire travels almost at the speed of light, which is orders of magnitudes larger than the other relevant time scales in the power system). If there is not a balance between consumption and production of electricity, the frequency of the grid alternating current will change. The predetermined target frequency is 50 Hz

Therefore, special measures have to be taken on the physical market (which is coupled with actual delivery).

 In deregulated markets: Power price is set by the marginal cost. The cost of the power plant with the highest operation cost sets the price for everyone. COPY
