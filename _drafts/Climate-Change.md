In a previous blog [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-16-Existential-Risk %}), I wrote about existential risks on different time scales. One existential risk I have been especially interested in for the last 5 year is climate change. Just as artificial general intelligence (AGI), climate change is an urgent existential risk and needs to be dealt with during this century. However, in contrast to the development of AGI, we know to a high degree of certainty both what is causing climate change and what we must do to limit its impact and avoid devastating consequences. But still, we ignorantly take life as we know it for granted and our politicians are reluctant to act at the required pace postulated by climate scientists to keep Earth in a safe operating space. Both of which are mind-boggling to me. In this blog post, I will review what is causing climate change and what its potential consequences are.

### How does the climate change?

Ever since the formation of the Earth, its climate has been changing dynamically due to factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by the Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, changes in albedo and greenhouse gas concentrations. In fact, the miraculously stable state we are used to, called the Holocene, has only been present for the last 10 000 years or so. To get here, it as been a bumpy ride as illustrated below.

The data comes from Greenland ice core data. Temperatures can be derived from the concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses preserved in small bubbles trapped in the ice core. When I look at this figure, I get amazed how lucky we humans have been for the going into the Holocene. It is our Garden of Eden, the only place we know of that can sustain widespread modern life on Earth. It is also, most probably, the one reason that allowed us to become farmers in the first place.

The mechanisms affecting climate change are called climate forcings and they can either be amplified or diminish by the Earth's feedback system. For example, as the Earth gets hotter the polar ice caps are melting changing the color of the ground from white to dark. As dark colors absorb more light the Earth is getting even warmer and more ice melts. This is an example of a positive feedback loop where an initial push in the wrong direction can lead to an irreversible new state without ice coverage on the poles. In this new iceless state, the mean temperature would be significantly larger.

The concept of planetary feedback is commonly referred to as resilience by climate scientists. A resilient ecosystem is capable of maintaining the same state in the presence of internal or external pressure. But continuous exposure to pressure might deteriorate the system, making it less rebust. A hard enough push, or an slow but steady transition, might irreversibly change the state (or regime) of the system. For example, temperature rises could potentially turn the Earth into new state without any glaciers. Or if temperatures decreases for some reason, it could lead us into an ice age. The transition from one state to another is usually characterized by nonlinear tipping points where the system feedback changes from negative to positive. The implications of new state are very hard to make, we must expect the unexpected. Visually, you can imagine the different states as stable equilibrium points of a ball in a gravitational field as illustrated below.

### Welcome to the anthropocene

 During the last 50 years, after 10 000 year of Holocene, the Earth has tipped into a new state, the Anthropocene. In this state it is we, the humans, how is the largest force acting on the planet. The population increase and the advances in our standards of life and technology are putting immense pressure on the planet. Human activity is causing deforestation, loss of biodiversity and increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from energy transformation, transport and animal husbandry to mention a few. In the last 50 year, we have gone from a small world on a big planet to a big world on a small planet. We can no longer treat the planet as a vast, stable and self-regulating system with unlimited resources.

The Holocene is our cherished home and we do not know what to expect in other states. Therefore, goal in the Antropocene and coming century is to keep the Earth in a Holocene-like state. Researchers at [Stockholm Resilience Center](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/) mapped out the potential threats that potentially could push the planet out of the Holocene into the unkown. They called their framework [planetary bounderies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries), which is the safe operating space of the world. Later on, they revised the framework to also include the lower boundary needed sustain the world population and fulfill the [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) (SDG) by the UN. This trade-off resulted in a doughnut-shape just and safe operating space for humanity shown below.

This doughnut points towards a future that can provide for everyones needs while safeguarding the living world on which we all depend. Notice that climate change is only one of the planetary boundaries. Moreover, all boundaries are hyperconnected and affect each other. For example, climate change could lead to less availability of fresh water. The planetary boundaries framework is an holistic approach that gives the big picture of our safe operating space. We need to deal with all challenges threatening the development our modern society. At this point however, climate change is one of the most urgent boundaries (together with loss of biodiversity and overload of nitrogen and phosphorus). It must therefore be one of the first to be dealt with.

### Global warming

The anthropogenic climate change is called global warming. Today, the planet is heating at a rate unprecedented in all of recoded history. This is more evident than every before. A great visualization of this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4Ra2HR27pQ). Furthermore, we have been aware of this for a long time. The mathematician Joseph Fourier showed already in 1824 that without the presence of the atmosphere, the Earth would be far colder. The Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius, build upon this and discovered in 1896 that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere affects the mean temperature on Earth. This effect is caused by heat trapping gases letting visible light from the sun pass and absorbing low frequency infrared radiation emitted form the Earth. Today, link between greenhouse gases and increase in mean temperature is clear for the vast majority of scientists. In the [IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 2014](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/), it was concluded that:

<p class="message">
"Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven
largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in
at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers,
have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been
the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."

The impacts of climate change will differ depending on the geographical region. Some of the anticipated effects are increased global mean temperature, rising sea levels and expansion of deserts into the subtropics. Even if it is very hard to pinpoint a specific extreme weather, it is clear from a statistical viewpoint that these events will become more common with global warming. It can be seen from the record of global temperature that it is composed of fluctuations on several time scales. Therefore, it is not sure that a following year will be hotter than its preceding year. However, it can be said to a quite high degree of certainty that a following decade will be hotter than its preceding decade.


Since the climate system (atmosphere, oceans and geosphere) has a high degree of inertia, it is likely that the coming effects of climate change will persist for many decades and centuries to come. Picture it like one of those big cruisers cutting through the water at full blast and suddenly turning of the engines. The inertia of the cruiser would keep it on course for a good while. Exactly the same is true for the climate system. Many experts already think that, when accounting for this, we have crossed the 2 degree Celsius goal agreed upon by the United Nations.

But it is still possible to limit the damage done by global warming. The first place to start is by limiting the root cause by reducing the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions have stopped to increase. However, in order to have a reasonable chance to limit the global warming to 2 degrees, zero emissions by the end of the century is needed.
