Therefore, special measures have to be taken on the physical market (which is coupled with actual delivery).

Power trading
 If you want to break • the bike, you have to pay someone that
bikes as much as you break •
If you want to consume electricity you have to pay someone that generates as much as you consume
This has to be measu- red for a specific time
The trading is measured for a specific time (MWh/h)

There is sometimes limited transmission from north to south
New generation in the South demand less grid reinforcement than new generation in the north
Transmission of power over long distances also gives more losses



Grid limitations take into account N-1 fault.

• Defined as highest transfer that after the dimensioning N-1 fault leads to ‘stable’ conditions

• Normally, the transfer shall within 15 minutes after a fault have been reduced to a limit where the system can withstand another fault
• Lack of sufficient generation reserves to reduce transfer may therefore limit transfer sections further than the dimensioning fault

Three main cross-sections which in some situations are congested.
When capacity is not sufficient between price areas this is handled by splitting the market into price areas.

## Deregulation of power systems
In the first half of the 20th century, most electrical power systems around the world were vertically integrated. This means that the same company did generation, transmission, distribution, metering and billing. Governmental institutions regulated the rate of return and cost structure. Starting out in the 1970s and 1980s, nations began to deregulate the power systems allowing for private participants. These participants had to coordinate, which was the birth of the electricity markets. In deregulated power systems, all parts except the transmission network are transformed into competitive markets. However, in practice the number of generating participates is not very large and parallel distribution networks are too expensive. Therefore, competition is not perfect in the current deregulated power systems.

Transmission companies determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line (ordinarily less than its physical or thermal limit) to ensure that spare capacity is available in the event of a failure in another part of the network.

 Day-ahead, intraday and balancing markets
• Marginal pricing, bidding, competition and the ”invisible hand of a market”
• Impact of vRES (average price, price volatility)
• Auctions versus continuous trading
• Link to production planning and power system
• Capacity payments

• Feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, RES quota & certificate markets, other incentives
Different types of markets
• Liberalised markets with wholesale and retail competition
• Liberalised markets without retail competition
• Single-buyer markets
• Regulated vertically integrated monopolies

Use the IEA report explaining different markets designs.

What is expected in the future:
• Energy-only markets or capacity markets
• Intraday trading
• Length of trading/settlement periods
• Forecasting wind
• More flexible generation, distributed generation
• Integrating demand side
• Central control of vRES
