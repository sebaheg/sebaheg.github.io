If it wasnt for us disturbing the planet, we would have been set for a coming 30 000 to 50 000 thusand year of holocene.

Earth is a single system

Not evenly distributed over different populations


Not everyone has contributed to the same degree. see graphs.

Will steffen et al writes in their paper:
 <p class="message">
"The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective."

 These graphs with ‘splits’ are important in exploring equity issues in terms of the differential pressures that various groups of countries apply to the Earth System and how the distribution of these pres- sures among groups is changing through time.
 IDEA: It is not completely correct to talk about mankind that is causing this. Many cultures on the planet has nothing to do with the great acceleration. but they are paying the price anyway.



What is the great acceleration:
n a similar vein, the term ‘Great Acceleration’ aims to capture the holistic, comprehensive and interlinked nature of the post-1950 changes simultaneously sweeping across the socio-economic and biophysical spheres of the Earth System, encompassing far more than climate change.

Thus, in this case human-driven changes are well outside the range of natural variability exhibited by the Earth system for the last half-million years at least.  

there is convincing evidence that the parameters have moved well outside of the Holocene envelope of variability. The atmospheric concentrations of the three greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane – are now well above the maximum observed at any time during the Holocene (Ciais

  Of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective. It is only beyond the mid- 20th century that there is clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are (1) beyond the range of variability of the Holocene, and (2) driven by human activities and not by natural variability.

"After 1950 you can see that major Earth System changes became directly linked to changes largely related to the global economic system," said Steffen. "This is a new phenomenon and indicates that humanity has a new responsibility at a global level for the planet."




The findings provide strong evidence that in recent decades, key components of the Earth System have moved beyond the natural variability exhibited in the last 12,000 years, a period geologists call the Holocene.

It is difficult to overestimate the scale and speed of change. In a single lifetime humanity has become a planetary-scale geological force.





industiral revolution started in 1750

Except maybe temperature, we have left the space of environment stability that signifies the Holocene

Great acceleration is affecting the biosphere. We humans are using resources and energy and land on such a scale that we are changing the biosphere. The biosphere is such as complex system so we do not really know how we are chaning it. The great acceleration is a big deal.



As it states in their paper: "Of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective. It is only beyond the mid-20th century that there is clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene, and driven by human activities and not by natural variability."


Planetary boundaries, the Great Acceleration, and the Anthropocene are all basically parts of the same picture.
How does these fit together?

However there are other features of the new analysis which are probably more interesting, as the Great Acceleration itself is fairly obvious, even though it might not be common knowledge how rapid it has been, or how recently in historical terms it has taken of

The rate of increase in land cultivated for agriculture is slowing down, as the amount of remaining suitable land declines. The number of large dams is no longer growing so rapidly, as it is limited by the number of large rivers. There has been a fall in the volume of fish caught in the oceans (and a shift to aquaculture) because of a reduction in wild fish stocks.   The stratospheric ozone layer has stabilised, due to international agreement to phase out CFCs. Population growth is no longer exponential, and there is now a possibility that world population might stabilise later this century.
Idea: some indicators are slowing down. But much because of that the resources allowing is depleting.


Within that argument, there is another argument going on, which is about the date of the start of the Anthropocene. Some have proposed the industrial revolution as the starting point for this fundamental change. But the graphs indicate that a much more dramatic change set in around 1950, the beginning of the Great Acceleration. The paper says: “… the evidence of large-scale shifts in Earth System functioning prior to 1950 is weak. Of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.” COPY







Extinction rates are 100-1000 times background levels.

Time epochs are usually defined by abrupt change in the biosphere. Just like the dinosours.

Holocene would continue 20 000 to 30 000 thusands years if we would not interfer with it.

The anthropocene puts climate change in a much wider context.

The great acceleration started 1950

Until the industrial revolution humans and their activities played an insignificant force in the dynamics of the Earth system.  Today, humankind has begun to match and even exceed nature in terms of changing the biosphere and affecting other facets of Earth system functioning.  


r 1950 you can see that major Earth System changes became directly linked to changes largely related to the global economic system. This is a new phenomenon and indicates that humanity has a new responsibility at a global level for the planet,” he added. COPy

Since the second world war.

We mange 3/4 of all lands outside the ice sheets.

The findings provide strong evidence that in recent decades key components of the Earth System have moved beyond the natural variability exhibited in the last 12,000 years, a period geologists call the Holocene.  The Holocene, Latin for “entirely recent”, began at the end of the last ice age and provided the stability for agriculture to develop, leading eventually to townships and cities to flourish.

The Great Acceleration trends support the proposal that Earth has entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene,

per argues that, “Of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.

This points to the profound scale of global inequality, which distorts the distribution of the benefits of the Great Acceleration and confounds international efforts, for example climate agreements, to deal with its impacts on the Earth System.

The second half of the 20th Century is unique in the history of human existence. Many human activites reached take-off points sometime in the 20th Century and sharply accelerated towards the end of the century.

The last 60 years have without doubt seen the most profound transformation of the human relationship with the natural world in the history of humankind. COPY

The effects of the accelerating human changes are now clearly discernible at the Earth system level. Many key indicators of the functioning of the Earth system are now showing responses that are, at least in part, driven by the changing human imprint on the planet. The human imprint influences all components of the global environment - oceans, coastal zone, atmosphere, and land.
Dramatic though these human-driven impacts appear to be, their rates and magnitudes must be compared to the natural patterns of variability in the Earth system to begin to understand their significance.

To develop a world-wide accepted strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against human induced stresses will be one of the great future tasks of mankind, requiring intensive research efforts and wise application of the knowledge thus acquired in the noösphere, better known as knowledge or information society.


“It is difficult to overestimate the scale and speed of change. In a
single lifetime humanity has become a planetary-scale geological force,” says lead author Professor Will Steffen, who led the joint project between the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the Stockholm Resilience Centre.

. The most dramatic shifts have occurred since 1950. We can say that around 1950 was the start of the Great Acceleration,” said Professor Steffen

Co-author IGBP Deputy Director, Dr Wendy Broadgate said, "The Great Acceleration indicators allow us to distinguish the signal from the noise. Earth is in a quantifiably different state than before. Several significant Earth System processes are now driven by human consumption and production."

In little over two generations – or a single lifetime – humanity (or until very recently a small fraction of it) has become a planetary-scale geological force. Hitherto human activities were insignificant compared with the biophysical Earth System, and the two could operate indepen- dently. However, it is now impossible to view one as separate from the other. The Great Acceleration trends provide a dynamic view of the emergent, planetary-scale coupling, via globalisation, between the socio-economic system and the biophysical Earth System. We have reached a point where many biophysical indicators have clearly moved beyond the bounds of Holocene variability. We are now living in a no-analogue world.
IDEA: use this to rap up.

### What is the way forward?
Periods of growth, then collapse, followed by reorganisation is a common pattern in the human past (Costanza et al., 2006).
There are several glimmers of hope that the growth/collapse pattern may be avoided. As noted in the section ‘Extending the Great Acceleration to 2010’, exponential population growth is over and global population seems
more likely to stabilise this century.

On the other hand, greenhouse gases are still rising rapidly, threatening the stability of the cli- mate system, and tropical forest and woodland loss remains high. The pursuit of growth in the global economy continues, but responsibility for its impacts on the Earth System has not been taken. Planetary stewardship has yet to emerge.
Can we become planetary stewards?

Will the next 50 years bring the Great Decoupling or the Great Collapse? The latest 10 years of the Great Acceleration graphs show signs of both but cannot distinguish between these scenarios, or other possibilities. But 100 years on from the advent of the Great Acceleration, in 2050, we’ll almost certainly know the answer.

Anthropence, the time interval in which human activities now rival global geophysical processes, suggests that we need to fundamentally alter our relationship with the planet we inhabit.The need to achieve effective planetary stewardship is urgent. As we go further into the Anthropocene, we risk driving the Earth System onto a trajectory toward more hostile states from which we cannot easily return.

Our capitalist system is an obsolete engine that needs tweeking.

I might be a Ecological modernist. But I do not think it is reasonable to think that we will all change standards of living. I think we can use technology in the right direction.

Can we put the system back into a state that we know is stable?
